Who's up 4 What is my second project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.  

This app has not been launched yet so users will not be able to login using their facebook accounts.

Who's Up 4 What is a social network that allows users to organize with their friends in a clear and direct way.  
Facebook is great, but the cat-memes have gotten out of control and the possibility of a "who's up for food post?" being noticed these days is slim.

Sections
This app has 3 Sections that users can post to and join their friend's posts.

Up 4 Food - Posts to organize friends to grab food or drinks

Up 4 Fun - Posts to organize activities.  Basketball Tonight? Ski trip this weekend?  Taylor Swift Concert?

Up 4 Discussion - This section is for users looking to talk to someone in their network about a specific topic.  Not everyone is looking to go to a chatroom to speak with total strangers.

Posts

Posts have a join button telling their friend that they want to be a part of that activity.  
Posts have an expiration date.  When the date for the post passes, the post will disappear.

Goals
The goal of this app is for people to better connect with friends in their network.  It is about discovery and reconnecting. You never know who may be up for what you are!
You never knew Joe from the gym also loves Pokemon!  And WOW, Steph from your town is up for the J Cole concert! I haven't talked to her in forever!


Future 

I will continue to work on this side project and get it launched where anyone can log in with their facebook account.
This app is only useful if your facbeook friends are also using it so once it launches please spread the word!

Future updates to include
- user homepage showing posts and activity
- email notification option when a friend joins a post
- sorting of posts/friends
